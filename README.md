My first attempts of web scraping

The task:

The user inputs the number of pages to analyze and the type of article.
Then the script should scan all the pages of the syte https://www.nature.com/nature/articles?sort=PubDate&year=2020 from 1 to the number of pages and download the body of all the articles with the type from input.
Then the script should save this content in the folders "Page_1", "Page_2", etc.
